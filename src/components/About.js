              Hello! Welcome to my professional portfolio. My name is Hannah Kim
              Chung and I am originally from the Bay Area and now reside in Los
              Angeles County.
              <br />
              <br />
              First of all, I would like to say thank you for taking the time to
              look at my page. I receievd my Bachelors of Arts degree in Child
              Adolescent Development and had a career working with children for
              the past 14 years. However, I felt that it was time for a career
              change and decided on web development.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am new to web development and decided to sign up for a bootcamp
              couse. I am currently taking the bootcamp course at University of
              California San Diego Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp
              Extension Studies.
              <br />
              <br />I am ready and determined to learn all about coding. I look
              foward to see where I would like to go with web development as I
              learn and suceed in it.
